## Instructions

Write any anime/manga title, then click 'find anime'. Then choose any genre you like and click 'recommend me'. The list of recommended animes should appear under the page.

## Algorithm

This project uses TD-IDF vectorization to recommend animes based on description similarity between the target anime and random sample (100) of animes picked up from Anilist API (https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/).
